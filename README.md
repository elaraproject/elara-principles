# Guiding Principles for the Elara Project

## Free Software, No Patents

All of the source code relating to Project Elara will be open-sourced and provided freely to anyone who wishes to obtain a copy of it. Financial considerations will not be taken into account, and no technologies developed directly or indirectly from the project will be allowed to be patented. I will not profit from this project in any way.

## Open to all

While primarily a single-person effort, the project is open to contributions (pull requests) from all. If contributions are taken, credit will be given where it is due. I will not claim singular or substantial credit.

## Benefit all

The innovations brought by the project will not be left in the hands of a powerful few. The innovations will belong to everyone. The primary motivation for the project will not be for profit, but instead, to progress our civilization forward and leave a better world for our children.

## No outside influences

The project should not fall into the hands of one specific person, nation, or company. The project will not accept monetary funding from persons or groups seeking to influence the project. The project's source code may not be re-licensed under a nonfree software license.

## Don't be evil

No, seriously, this time. Don't be like Google, or Apple, or Facebook, or OpenAI. Don't be like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk. This time, I will be bound by my words.

## Full accountability and transparency

These guidelines will not be removed. They will not be changed lightly. And if I'm not doing something right, tell me.
